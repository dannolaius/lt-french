# Lesson 5: Unfolding words, later and locking.



*Of* is **de** in French. Like we saw in the verb **demander**.

How would you say *'Do you want a piece of cake?'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Veux-tu un peu de gateau"/>

So the verb *'complicate* would be **compliquer** consisting of the parts **com** and **pliquer**
**pliquer** also exists in the French word for *explain*, **expliquer** (kind of like *inexplicable*)

**pliquer** actually means something like *folding*. If something is complicated, it's folded up and when it gets explained it's "ex-folded up", unfolded. When you analyze the word and figure out how it expresses it's meaning you can remember it better than if you're just purely memorize. It can also help you understand new words you might come across like **dupliquer** literallym meaning two-fold or *duplicate*.

How would you say *'can you explain?'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Peux-tu expliquer?"/>

The actual word for *'to fold'* in French loses the k sound and is just **plier**. How would you say *'Can you fold the pants?'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Peux-tu plier le pantalon"/>

## Late in French.

The word for *late* in French is **tard** It also exists in some dialects of English where we can say 'I'm arriving a bit tardy'.

How would you say *'A little late'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Un peu tard"/>

The way to say *later* in French is **plus tard** where **plus** literally means *more* or *plus* in English.

How would you say *'I can reserve something later'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je peux réserver quelque chose plus tard"/>

How do you say *'Can you order something later?'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Peux-tu commander quelque chose plus tard"/>

You might also hear **À plus tard** meaning *see you later*.

## To lock in French

We previously learned that *to close* was **Fermer** from confirm. The way to say *to lock* is **Fermer à clé** literally *to close to key*.


How would you say *'you can close the door later'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Tu peux fermer à clé la porte plus tard"/>
