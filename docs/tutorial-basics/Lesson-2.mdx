# Lesson 2: French loan-verbs

## You even know French verbs!

Last lesson we learned that we can convert a bunch of nouns from English to French that end in *-ION* (confirmation, opinion, organisation, etc). 

In English we can create verbs out of these *-ION* nouns by adding *to* in front of the word and removing the *-ION*

- *Confirmation* → *to confirm*
- *Oraganisation* → *to organize*

This can also be done in French for words that end in not just *-ION* but *-ATION* by removing the *-ATION* and adding *-ER*.

For Example:

- **Cofirmation** → **Confirmer** (meaning *to confirm*)
- **Oraganisation** → **Organiser** (meaning *to organize*)

Let's practice!

How would you say *'Celebration'* in French:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Célébration"/>

How would you say *'I want to celebrate'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je veux célébrer"/>

How would you say *'Do you want to celebrate'?*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Tu veux célébrer"/>

You might want to answer this question with **un peu**, which means *a little* in French.

Let's do the same for participation

How would you say *'I want to participate'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer={<span>Je veux participer</span>}/>

One of the hard parts is realizing that we know the right *'-ATION'* word for the occasion. 

You might've wanted to say something like *'I want to get involved'*, and not have thought to use *'to participate'* for *'to get involved'* 

This might be because *'I want to participate'* sounds very formal. But the Latin derived word does not have that formal feel to it in French.

One more exercise, how would you say *'I want to visit'*

<TranslationAnswer answer={<span>
  <p>Je veux visiter</p>
  <p>Explaination: Get <strong>visiter</strong> from <em>'visitation'</em></p>
</span>}/>
