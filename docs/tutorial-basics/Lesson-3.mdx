# Lesson 3: More verbs, to be able to and something


## More '-ATION' verbs and *something*

The way you say *something* is **quelque chose** where **quelque** means *some* and **chose** means *thing*

How would you say *'I want to reserve something:'* 

<TranslationAnswer answer={<span>
  <p>Je veux réserver quelque chose</p>
  <p>Explaination: Get <strong>réserver</strong> from <em>'reservation' remove '-ation' add '-er'</em></p>
</span>}/>

Unfortunately not every English '-ation' word is going to translate into a French word 1 to 1, sometimes there will be small differences. For example we have the English *recommendation* that translates to **recommandation**.

How would you say *'I want to recommend something'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je veux recommander quelque chose"/>

If you remove the *re-* we get **commander** meaning *'to order'*.

## 'To be able to'  in French

*'To be able to'* or *'can'* is **peux** in French. Just like with **veux** we don't pronouce the x at the end.

**Peux** is actually pronounced the same way as *a little* which we previously learned was **un peu**.

So how would you say *'You can celebrate a little'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Tu peux célebrer un peu"/>

A way to remember the word **peux** is that it is reletated to the words *power* and *possibilty* in English. Which makes sense as what you can and what you are able to do is related to your possibilities and your power

Now how would you say *'I can recommend something'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je peux recommander quelque chose"/>
