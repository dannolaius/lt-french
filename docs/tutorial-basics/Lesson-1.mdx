# Lesson 1: French Loanwords and grammatical gender

## You already know a bunch of French!

English is a language that is half germanic and half Latin. If there are two words for something the formal one is usually derived from Latin while the informal one is derived from German. For example: **ask** sounds very Germanic while **enquire** sounds more Latin..

The Latin word is often going to sound like a French word, so you already know a lot of French words from English, even if you don't realize it!

For example: 

- **Gâteau** meaning *cake* (word for a certain type of cake in english)
- **Café** meaning *coffee*

To say *the cake* or *the coffee* you need to add the word **le** in front of the word.

How would you say *'the coffee'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Le café"/>

## To *'want'* something

To say I want you say **Je veux**. Je meaning *I* and **veux** meaning *want*. **Veux** is related to *volunteer*, someone that wants to do something.

So how would you say *'I want the cake'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je veux le gâteau"/>

and *'I want the coffee'*

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je veux le café"/>

If you want to say *it* like 'I want it' you use the same word for it as the word for *the*, **le**.

But the **le** has to be put before the *want* in French.

So how would you say *'I want it'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je le veux"/>

To say *you want* you say **tu veux**. 

How would you say *'you want the cake'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Tu veux la gâteu"/>

To make it into a question like *Do you want cake?* you can do that by changing the intonation.

## More Latin Loanwords and grammatical gender.

There are strategies we can use to identify huge groups of English words that are the same in French. One of them being words that end in *'-ion'*

For example:

- **Collection** - *Collection*
- **Oragnisation** - *Organisation*
- **Tradition** - *Tradition*
- **Réservation** - *Reservation*
- **Opinion** - *Opinion*
- **Passion** - *Passion*

When you want to say *the collection* you say **la collection**. You might notice this is different than how we said *the cake* - **le gâteau**

This is because French has grammatical gender. French nouns have a grammatical gender, the words are considered *masculine* or *feminine* 

The masculine nouns go with **le** and the feminine nouns go with **la**

How would you say *'I want the collection'*

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je veux la collection>"/>

How would you say *'Do you want the collection'*

<TranslationAnswer answer="Tu veux la collection?"/>

We mentioned earlier that the word for *'the'* is the same as the word for *'it'*. How would you say *'I want it'* if we by *'it'* mean *'the confirmation'* - **la confirmation**

<TranslationAnswer answer="Je la veux"/>

If the noun you want to put **le/la** in front us starts with a vowel like **opinion**
we will lose the e/a on le/la and get **l'opinion**
