# Lesson 4: Inversion to ask questions and etymology

## Asking questions

Previously we learned that we can create a question by just changing the tone of voice. But there is another way. By flipping the subject and verb around!

We actually do the same thing in English, for example *'you can'* can become *'can you?'* in a question.

The way you to it in French is by changing the order and adding a '-' between the words.

So *'can you'* would be **peux-tu** in French.

So would you say *'Can you explore a little'* using this inversion method:

<TranslationAnswer answer={<span>
  <p>Peux-tu explorer un peu</p>
  <p>Explaination: Get explorer from <em>'exploration'</em> remove '-ation' add '-er'</p>
</span>}/>

How would you say *'Can you confirm it?'*

<TranslationAnswer answer="Veux-tu le confirmer"/>


## More etymology

**Confirmer** used to in older french be *confermer*. Which means it was originally built on the two parts **con** and **fermer**.

**Con** or **com** is a latin prefix meaning *'with'* that you'll find in the beginning of many words such as *complicate, compare, conflict etc* and **fermer** means *to close*, related to *'firm'* in English.


The door in french is **la porte**, like *portal*. so how would you say *'can you close the door?'*:

<TranslationAnswer answer="Peux-tu fermer la porte?"/>

Let's similarly break down **commander** meaning *to order*. It also consist of obviously the previously discussed prefix **com** and then **mander**

**Mander** is a very uncommon verb only used in literatture but it can still be useful to think about mander and where else we can find it. To experiment with adding other latin bits and pieces to it and se if we can find other words.

For example in English *demand* also shares this base. The way to say *to demand* is **demander** in French.

So **recommander, commander, mander, demander r√©primander** all share this base that comes from **la main** which means the hand.

Understanding and playing around with these roots and prefixes can be a great way to find connections among French words and between French and English words.
